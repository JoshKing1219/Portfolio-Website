        <p>
          Overcoming great struggles in life has allowed me to gain a unique
          perspective on the world we live in and how the people who inhabit it
          interact with each other. Through these struggles I have learned
          valuable lessons such as: problem-solving, navigating through hostile
          and toxic environments, interacting with humans who may not have
          working communication skills (or humans who haven't learned to
          communicate in a healthy and professional manner), how to manage
          difficult and complicated tasks, how to manage my own emotions in a
          healthy and mentally beneficial way, and countless others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Navigating and learning the inner workings of the adult world mostly
          on my own has enabled me to learn first-hand the right, and wrong, way
          to do things. I have spent my entire adult life, from 17-years-old to
          present, working in customer service related fields (food service,
          custodial and retail specifically) and thanks to this experience I
          have developed essential skils that ensures all of the customers I
          work with leave happy and with all of their needs met.

          <h3 class="secondary-title">Growing Up In An Evolving World</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          From an early age I strived to pursue education as my career choice
          because of my interest in helping provide knowledge to others. During
          my childhood I was introduced to various sorts of techology as it
          began to rapidly develop. From Atari and Playstation 2 to Smartphones
          and overpowered Gaming PCs, I watched as the world began to evolve to
          a new age where technology began to take over every walk of life in
          some way, shape, or form. As I became an adult during this shift, my
          career interests started to veer onto the course of technology instead
          of education. I pursued these new interests during my teenage and
          early adult years by joining different social media platforms such as
          Facebook, Myspace, Instagram, TikTok, and others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years I've managed numerous accounts on various social media
          apps. The one that I'm most proud of was an account on TikTok where I
          created an intricate fictional universe just using a simple Wheel app
          that I customized as the fictional story progressed with each wheel.
          You can find the page here
          <a
            href="https://www.tiktok.com/@talesofthewheelverse?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc"
            >@TalesOfTheWheelverse</a
          >. I learned many valuable skills during the years I managed this
          TikTok page including: video editing, sound editing, watching and
          staying relevant to current trends, and many others. While managing
          this page I was able to explore more of my interests in social media
          and video editing and I also, unintentionally, became a trend setter
          as the videos I made ended up changing how all of the other similar
          accounts edited their videos.

          <h3 class="secondary-title">What Interests Me</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          I spend most of my time either going on adventures with my wife,
          pursing my education in tech, gaming on PC or Playstation, or working.
          I enjoy reading when I have the time and my favorite book series is
          Escape From Furnace by Alexander Gordon-Smith. I also enjoy listening
          to various different genres of music like indie, metal, rock,
          pop, rap, country, and classical.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have some interest in writing and creating fictional things which
          I was able to pursue in great depth while managing the TikTok account
          mentioned above. What interests me most about writing is being able
          to create whatever you want and there being no limitations to what
          you can and cannot do.
        </p>
        <p>
          As my interests have developed to be more technologically inclined,
          I have explored the various fields that the tech industry has to offer
          which is when I discovered the basics of Cybersecurity and the layout
          of the career. Being able to protect people from those who would use
          technology malicously while simultaniously having the knowledge to
          prevent those scenarios is something that I strive to be able to do.
          As the tech industry evolves further, I have also found an interest in
          AI technology and full intend on expanding my knowledge into that area
          as well so that I am able to adapt and understand the new world that
          we are all walking into together. Being able to have extensive knowledge
          on technology interests me greatly and I'm always looking for new ways
          to challenge myself and new things to learn as they become available.
